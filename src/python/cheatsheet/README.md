# Python Cheat Sheet

*Last edited: 2024-11-28*

*Python â€“ Cheat Sheet*, by Valdemar W. Setzer [[Source, in Portuguese](https://www.ime.usp.br/~vwsetzer/python-opers-funcoes.html)] - this directory contains my attempt to help build the cheat sheet by describing some functions and modules that are not yet in the sheet. It is a work in progress and subject to constant change.

## Notebooks

* [cheasheeaux.ipynb]({{repo}}python/notebooks/cheasheeaux.ipynb) - auxiliary Notebook used in the cheat sheet to confirm the operation of some items.

## Other files

* [python-folha-de-consulta-v17.2.html](python-folha-de-consulta-v17.2.html) - 2024-11-26 backup copy of the original document.
* [variables.ipynb]({{repo}}python/notebooks/variables.ipynb) - my personal notes on how Python variables work.
