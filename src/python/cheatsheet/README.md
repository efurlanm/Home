# Python Cheat Sheet

*Last edited: 2024-11-28*

*Python â€“ Cheat Sheet*, by Valdemar W. Setzer [[Source, in Portuguese](https://www.ime.usp.br/~vwsetzer/python-opers-funcoes.html)] - this directory contains my attempt to help build the cheat sheet by describing some functions and modules that are not yet in the sheet. It is a work in progress and subject to constant change.

## Current work

- PDF: [python-opers-funcoes.pdf](pythonopersfuncoes.pdf)
- HTML: [pythonopersfuncoes.html](pythonopersfuncoes.html)

## Comments

- Use Python 3 links like: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US&_x_tr_pto=wapp>. In the text there are links that point to version 2.

## Notebooks

* [cheasheeaux.ipynb]({{repo}}python/notebooks/cheasheeaux.ipynb) - auxiliary Notebook used in the cheat sheet to confirm the operation of some items.

## Other files

* [python-folha-de-consulta-v17.2.html](python-folha-de-consulta-v17.2.html) - 2024-11-26 backup copy of the original document.
* [variables.ipynb]({{repo}}python/notebooks/variables.ipynb) - my personal notes on how Python variables work.
